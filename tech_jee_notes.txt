internet - (WAN - worldwide area network) global computer network (billlions of device connected)
	Wireline : copper/fiber - physical wireline / cable
	Wireless : satelites (NOT wifi)
	
	Home : (modem/router) physically connected to the wireline n/w
		TV, Laptop, phone,refrigeerator, thermostat, vaccum
		wifi - small distance(meters) wireless network
			connected to your modem/router
	Roaming : data plan on mobile
	
intranet - corporate/school computer network. (thousands of devices connected)
	unlimited communication within this walled garden.
	outside communication with internet more secure/scrutinized

LAN (Local area network )- Home computer network. (less than hundred devices connected)
	

ip - unique identifier of every device that is connected to internet

	8 billion = < 1 device ( phone, laptop, tablet, smart watch )
	100 billions connected to internet - each should have unique ip
		IPv4 = 0-255 . 0-255 . 0-255 . 0-255
			4 octet/ subnet
				123.25.67.234
				4.2 billion unique IPv4 address = 256 X 256 X 256 X 256
		IPv6	= 8 sequence (pair of 4 characters )
			xxxx : xxxx : xxxx : xxxx : xxxx : xxxx : xxxx : xxxx 
			0-9 a b  c d e f - hexadecimal
			95ae : xxxx : xxxx : xxxx : xxxx : xxxx : xxxx : xxxx 
			(16^4 ) ^8
			trillions of trillions of IPv6 addresses

port/socket - unique identifier of internet softwares running on a machine
	port - allows entrance into a device
		Flight - airport port of entry
		ship - docker port of entry
	Individual port is assigned to each internet software running on the device
	0-65535

dhcp  - provides unique ip address
dns - domain name server
router - pathway between 2 end point
load balancer - 

ipconfig - show my lan ip address
netstat -a - show all ports open
ping - remote machine is reachable and response time (round trip time)
telnet - website software is open on remote aws machine
tracert - find delay in the network (trace route)



Communication - IP and port

http://www.google.com/
	machine contact DNS and get ip for www.google.com - 1.2.3.4
1.2.3.4 80

DNS - Web ip address contact (just like phone contact)
	DNS - translation from domain name(www.google.com) to the IP address
www.google.com 1.2.3.4
www.facebook.com 2.3.4.5
www.amazon.com 4.5.6.7
